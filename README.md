## About The Project

* Read the [docs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/docs)
* Look into other [examples](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/examples) to learn how to spawn an IPFS node in Node.js and in the Browser
* Consult the [Core API docs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/docs/core-api) to see what you can do with an IPFS node
* Visit https://dweb-primer.ipfs.io to learn about IPFS and the concepts that underpin it
* Head over to https://proto.school to take interactive tutorials that cover core IPFS APIs
* Check out https://docs.ipfs.io for tips, how-tos and more

* Need help? Please ask 'How do I?' questions on https://discuss.ipfs.io

## Getting Started

**TODO:** _This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps._

### Prerequisites

**TODO:** _This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them._

```console
$ npm install -g ipfs
```

### Installation

**TODO:** _This is an example of how to perform the installation_

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start an IPFS node
   ```console
    $ jsipfs daemon
    Initializing IPFS daemon...
    js-ipfs version: x.x.x
    System version: x64/darwin
    Node.js version: x.x.x
    Swarm listening on /ip4/127.0
    .... more output
   ```

## Usage

**TODO:** _Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources._

How to add a file to the local IPFS node:

```console
$ jsipfs add ./hello-world.txt
added QmXXY5ZxbtuYj6DnfApLiGstzPN7fvSyigrRee3hDWPCaf hello-world.txt
```

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](#documentation)_

The IPFS implementation in JavaScript needs your help!  There are a few things you can do right now to help out:

Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and [JavaScript Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING_JS.md).

- **Check out existing issues** The [issue list](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues) has many that are marked as ['help wanted'](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) or ['difficulty:easy'](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Adifficulty%3Aeasy) which make great starting points for development, many of which can be tackled with no prior IPFS knowledge
- **Look at the [IPFS Roadmap](https://github.com/ipfs/roadmap)** This are the high priority items being worked on right now
- **Perform code reviews** More eyes will help
  a. speed the project along
  b. ensure quality, and
  c. reduce possible future bugs.
- **Add tests**. There can never be enough tests.
- **Join the [Weekly Core Implementations Call](https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt/issues/992)** it's where everyone discusses what's going on with IPFS and what's next
